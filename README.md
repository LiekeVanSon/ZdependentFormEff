This repository contains the code and data used in the paper:  
**"Not just winds: why models find binary black hole formation is metallicity dependent, while binary neutron star formation is not"**

## Repository Structure

- **`code/`** – Jupyter notebooks to reproduce all figures from the paper.  
- **`code/run_data/`** – Scripts to reproduce the simulation data used in this work.  

## Reproducing the Results  

This study was conducted using [COMPAS](https://github.com/TeamCOMPAS/COMPAS) version **v03.01.02**.  
The full simulation output is available on Zenodo: [10.5281/zenodo.13999531](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13999531).  

Most figures can be recreated without downloading the full simulation data, as only the processed figure data is required.
